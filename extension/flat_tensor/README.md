## FlatTensor

FlatTensor is a flatbuffer-based format for storing and loading tensors. FlatTensor interoperates with the ExecuTorch PTE file, providing the option to store tensors outside of the PTE file. Majorly, this enables tensor sharing.

FlatTensor is still under development, and not ready to use.
